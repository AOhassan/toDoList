# toDoList
This To-Do List program takes in tasks (Items) as user input and puts them in a list. 
Then it allows you to check off tasks and clear tasks from the list. The checkbox 
and delete button were both created using the createElement method, which creates 
a specified element. The focus method selects the text box for user input. The 
function addItem takes in list and input as parameters, then adds the task inputed
in the text box to the list. The event listner methods for the checkBox and delete 
button pass functions in correspondance with an event,such as clicking the button. 
The appendChild method moves the elements, e.g. checkBox into the label. At the end
of the script the select method selects the input text and then its cleared from
within the form by replacing its value with an empty string.
